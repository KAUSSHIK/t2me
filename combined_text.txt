Iowa State University Undergraduate Research Assistant December 2021 - May 2022 (6 months) Dr. Mayly Sanchez's Lab The NOvA experiment conducted by Fermilab has a wealth of neutrino interaction data. Worked on a team of two to analyze this data by making plots of rare neutrino interaction data. Ran commands on my computer's Mac's Terminal to log in to Fermilab NoVA servers (novagpvms), plotted and Page 1 of 2 analyzed neutrino interaction data. Used the CAFAna framework (a framework written in C++) to make and study the plots.
